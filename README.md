# Data Structures and Algorithms

I intend to use this repository to implement useful data structures and solve various lists of algorithm challenges as
an opportunity to improve my programming skills and work on using different testing frameworks and strategies.

I plan to start with JavaScript (still my favorite) and hopefully move or evolve it into TypeScript and other future
languages I feel the need to get a better handle on.

I will do my best to implement data structures and algorithm solutions to the best of my knowledge on the first try, but
I also expect to eventually come back and refactor or add different and/or more optimal solutions.

Lastly, this will mostly be a repository of practice for me, but I might use it to create content in the future
explaining my thought process and the ways I do things.
